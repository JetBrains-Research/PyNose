# PyNose: a Test Smell Detector for Python

PyNose is a test smell detector tool for Python. The tool runs inside PyCharm IDE.

## Description

PyNose can be used inside the IDE to study the test smells within a specific
opened project. This can help python developers avoid test smells in their code.

[comment]: <> (installation??)

When you open a project in PyCharm, a number of inspections will be available for usage.

Some inspections are initially disabled, however you can enable them from the settings.

## Available inspections
