# PyNose: a Test Smell Detector for Python

PyNose is a test smell detector tool for Python. 
It runs as a plugin inside the PyCharm IDE (version 2021.3) 

**Note: PyNose is currently under active development, the older version of the tool that was initially described in the paper "PyNose: A Test Smell Detector For Python" can be found in the `ASE2021` branch.**

## How to use in PyCharm

1. Download the latest release of the plugin from [here](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/PyNose/releases);
2. Open PyCharm and go to `File`/`Settings`/`Plugins`;
3. Select the gear icon, and choose `Install Plugin from Disk...`;
4. Choose the downloaded ZIP archive;
5. Click `Apply`;
6. Restart the IDE.

## Description

PyNose can be used inside the IDE to study the test smells within a specific
opened project. This can help python developers avoid test smells in their code.

When you open a project in PyCharm, a number of inspections will be available for usage.

PyNose will retrieve the information about your currently configured Test Runner (`Preferences > Tools > Python Integrated Tools > Testing > Default test runner`) to use the appropriate set of inspections (*pytest* or *Unittest*).

Some inspections are initially disabled, however you can enable them from the settings.

## Available inspections

*Disabled by default. If enabled â€” weak warning.

## Headless mode
The headless mode can be useful for processing a large number of projects. 
In this mode, PyCharm will be launched in the background, the project will be analyzed, 
and all the results will be saved to JSON and CSV files. 

### How to use in headless mode

Create a folder containing all the projects you want to analyse. 
Analysis will be performed for all the projects in a row.

Create an output directory, where all the `.csv` and `.json` files will be located
after the analysis.

Download this project: `git clone https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/PyNose`

#### Steps to run headless mode from IDE:

Open this project in IntelliJ IDEA.

The IDE will prompt detecting a Gradle project.
Load this Gradle project by clicking `Load Gradle Project` option.

<br></br>
![Load gradle project](assets/load-gradle-project.png)
<br></br>

The IDE may also prompt that this is a project from the web. 
Click `Trust Project` to continue.

<br></br>
![Trust gradle project](assets/trust-project-prompt.png)
<br></br>

Open gradle side panel as shown below. 
Direct to `Tasks -> other` and choose the task called runCliHeadless. 

<br></br>
![Gradle panel](assets/gradle-panel.png)
<br></br>

In the edit configuration window set arguments as shown below

<br></br>
![Args](assets/run-conf.png)
<br></br>

Run `runHeadlessIde` task by clicking `Run`

<br></br>
![Run](assets/run.png)
<br></br>

### Steps to run headless mode from console:
Execute the following command with your arguments:

`./gradlew runHeadlessIde -P projectsStorage="Your folder with projects" -P outputDir="Yout output directory"`
