# PyNose: a Test Smell Detector for Python

PyNose is a test smell detector tool for Python. 
It runs as a plugin inside the PyCharm IDE (version 2021.3) 

**Note: PyNose is currently under active development, the older version of the tool that was initially described in the paper "PyNose: A Test Smell Detector For Python" can be found in the `ASE2021` branch.**

## How to use in PyCharm

1. Download the latest release of the plugin from [here](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/PyNose/releases);
2. Open PyCharm and go to `File`/`Settings`/`Plugins`;
3. Select the gear icon, and choose `Install Plugin from Disk...`;
4. Choose the downloaded ZIP archive;
5. Click `Apply`;
6. Restart the IDE.

## Description

PyNose can be used inside the IDE to study the test smells within a specific
opened project. This can help python developers avoid test smells in their code.

[comment]: <> (installation??)

When you open a project in PyCharm, a number of inspections will be available for usage.

PyNose will retrieve the information about your currently configured Test Runner (`Preferences > Tools > Python Integrated Tools > Testing > Default test runner`) to use the appropriate set of inspections (*pytest* or *Unittest*).

Some inspections are initially disabled, however you can enable them from the settings.

## Available inspections

*Disabled by default. If enabled â€” weak warning.
