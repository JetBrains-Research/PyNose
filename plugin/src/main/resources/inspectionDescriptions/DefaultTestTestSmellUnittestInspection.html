<b>Default Test (unittest)</b> occurs when an IDE creates default test suites
when the project is created and developers keep the default
name. For example, PyCharm by default names the test suites
<code>MyTestCase</code>. These suites are meant to serve as an example
for developers when writing unit tests and should be renamed.
Not renaming them upfront causes developers to start adding
test cases into these files, making the default test suite a
container of all test cases. This can also cause problems when
the suites need to be renamed in the future.
