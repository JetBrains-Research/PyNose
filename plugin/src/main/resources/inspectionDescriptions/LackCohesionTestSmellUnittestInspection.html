<b>Lack of Cohesion of Test Cases (unittest)</b> occurs if test cases are grouped together in one test suite but are not cohesive.
Cohesion of a class is a metric that indicates how well various parts and responsibilities of a class are tied together.
If test cases in a suite are not cohesive, this can cause comprehensibility and maintainability issues.
