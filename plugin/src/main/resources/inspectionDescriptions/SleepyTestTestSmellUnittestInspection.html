<b>Sleepy Test (unittest)</b> occurs when developers need to pause the execution of statements in a test case
for a certain duration (i.e., simulate an external event) and then continue with the execution.
Explicitly causing a thread to sleep can lead to unexpected results
as the processing time for a task can vary on different devices.
